# RTcmix Scores — Compositions by Saim Gülay

This repository contains my original compositions written entirely in [RTcmix](http://rtcmix.org), a real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition language. These works span a range of styles and systems: stochastic gesture, harmonic ambiguity, generative form, timbral architecture, and spatial experimentation.

Each `.sco` file here is a self-contained composition — a living score — where code and sound are inseparable.

## 🎧 Contents

- Generative harmonic textures using `STRUM2`, `WAVETABLE`, `MULTEQ`
- Stochastic melodic structures and rhythmic instability
- Use of modulation effects (`FLANGE`, `JDELAY`, `REVERBIT`) as compositional devices
- Experiments with pitch space, tuning systems, and formal emergence

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `scores/` — RTcmix `.sco` files
- `renders/` *(optional)* — audio renders (if added)
- `tools/` *(optional)* — helper scripts or tables

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- RTcmix (tested with recent builds on macOS and Linux)
- Some scores may require multichannel output configuration

## 🧠 About

I use RTcmix not as a plugin or backend, but as an instrument — a space where musical form and algorithm are collapsed into one. If you're curious about any score, process, or synthesis idea, feel free to open an issue or message me.
